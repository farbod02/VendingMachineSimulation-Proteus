# VendingMachineSimulation-Proteus
This Project was for Digital Systems course taught by Dr. Mehdi Delrobayi at the K. N.Toosi University of Technology | Spring of 2023

this is the project question
***
Consider an automated vending machine that sells two types of chocolates. The price of the first type of chocolate is 22 cents, and the second type is 54 cents. This machine only accepts coins of 4, 22, and 44 cents and returns change along with one chocolate. The machine's display (including a seven-segment display) shows the amount of money entered at any given time.

The operation of this machine is such that the desired chocolate is selected first, and then coins are inserted in sequence. If 22 seconds pass after selecting the chocolate without a coin being inserted, the machine returns to the initial state (chocolate selection).

To design this system, perform the following tasks:

Draw the state table.
Choose the type of state machine and draw the state diagram.
Optimize and design the circuit using the desired flip-flops.
Simulate the machine in Proteus software and execute at least three different scenarios - ensure that both chocolates are purchased in the scenarios.
Draw the timing diagram based on the considered inputs (scenarios).
Prepare a comprehensive report based on the mentioned items and submit it. Please note that any obvious similarities with others' work in the report will result in a grade deduction. Along with the report, upload the Proteus file (as a compressed file) on the platform.

The project score will be awarded after reviewing the report and conducting the final individual presentation. If the work is not presented, no score will be assigned to the course project.
